// like it should be able to do that, but the current implementation (as of
// Immutable 4.0.0-rc.12) takes time O(k log n): each step of the iterator
// passes through a stack of log(n) helper functions.  Ah well.
//
// The logs are base 32, so in practice our log(n) is never more than 3
// (which would be enough for 32**3 = 32768 items), usually at most 2
// (enough for 1024 items); and for the messages in one conversation, very
// commonly 1, i.e. there are commonly just ≤32 messages.  So the difference

/**
 * Delete the given messages from the unreads state.

 * existing messages is much larger.  Specifically the time spent should be
 * O(N' log n + c log C), where the messages to delete appear in c out of a
 * total of C conversations, and the affected conversations have a total of
 * N' messages and at most n in any one conversation.  If the messages to be
 * deleted are all at the start of the list for their respective
 * conversations the time should be O(k log n + c log C).
 *
 * For the common case of marking some messages as read, we expect that all
 * the affected messages will indeed be at the start of their respective
 * conversations, and the number c of affected conversations will be small,
 * typically 1.  (It could be more than 1 if reading a stream narrow, or
