/**
 * Gives a type error unless a T can be used as a U and vice versa.
 *
 * In other words this gives an error unless, in the preorder (*) where each
 * type A is a "subtype" of B just if an A can be used as a B, the types T
 * and U are equivalent.
 *
 * Handy when testing or debugging complex type expressions, to check that
 * they come out to something equivalent to what you think they are.
 *
 * When two types are equivalent (and neither one involves an "unclear" type
 * like `any`), they are interchangeable for any direct uses.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *   // These are two ways of spelling the same type.
 *   typesEquivalent<$ReadOnly<{| x: number |}>, {| +x: number |}>();
 *
 *   // FlowExpectedError - These are different types :-)
 *   typesEquivalent<number, number | void>(); // error
 *
 * Important caveat #1: When T or U is an "unclear type", i.e. one involving
 *   `any` or its less-common friends `Object` or `Function`, this can give
 *   misleading results.  In particular, `any` will be reported as
 *   "equivalent" to *whatever* type you try, even types that are not
 *   equivalent to each other.
 *
 *   This is because the subtype relation is only a preorder (*) when
 *   unclear types are excluded.  The meaning of `any` is that any A can be
 *   used as `any`, and `any` as any B, even when A can't be used as B; and
 *   that makes the relation not transitive.  The "equivalent" terminology
 *   really only makes sense in the context of a preorder.
 *
 *   Not 100% sure the subtype relation is entirely a preorder even without
 *   `any` and friends -- Flow is unfortunately not well documented at this
 *   conceptual level.
 *
 * Important caveat #2: Sometimes complex type operations like $Diff can
 *   take types that are equivalent in this sense and produce inequivalent
 *   results.  The only known examples of this involve types that probably
 *   shouldn't be equivalent in the first place, namely object types where
 *   the same property is optional on the one hand and required on the
 *   other.  See test `test_typesEquivalent_$Diff_surprise`.
 *
 * (*) "Preorder" means the relation is reflexive (A subtype A, for all A)
 *   and transitive (whenever A subtype B subtype C, then also A subtype C.)
 *
 * See also `IsSupertype`, which is suitable to use directly in type-level
 * expressions.

 * `L` happens to be more specific than on `U`.
 *
 * Assumes both U and L are exact, read-only, object types.  (If not,
 * behavior unknown.) Returns a solution, where possible, to the type

 * I.e., the most general type `D` such that `{| ...D, ...L |}` can be used
 * where a `U` is expected.  If there is no such `D`, causes a type error.
 *
 * In particular, this means:
 *  * Error if `L` has any extra properties that aren't in `U`.
 *  * Error unless each property of `L` has the same type as in `U`, or a subtype
 *    (i.e., the property's values in `L` are valid for `U`).
 *  * `D` has exactly the properties in `U` that aren't in `L`.

 * `SubsetProperties<T, {| frobMode?: mixed |}>` for an object type that
 * permits only the `frobMode` option, with the exact same type T allows,
 * but without having to repeat the details of that type.
 *
 * A limitation: this implementation can't tell which properties are
 * *optional* in T, i.e. spelled with `?:`, as in `foo?: number`.  Instead,
 * properties in the result will be optional or required based on how they
 * are in U.  To avoid confusion, be sure to make the same properties
 * optional in U as are optional in T.  (In the "options object" use case,

// optional, this will still be true after the $ObjMap, and so the second
// diff won't remove them and they'll all wind up in the resulting type.

// Possibly this will get better after a project to fix the handling of
// $Diff and other "type destructors", which as of 2020-08 the Flow team is

/**

 *
 * Especially useful for statically asserting that a `switch` statement is

 *       | {| type: 'twiddle', ... |};

 *
 *       default:
 *         ensureUnreachable(foo); // Asserts no possible cases for `foo` remain.
 *         break;
 *     }
 *
 * In this example if by mistake a case is omitted, or if another case is
 * added to the type without a corresponding `case` statement here, then
 * Flow will report a type error at the `ensureUnreachable` call.
