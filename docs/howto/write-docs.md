# Writing these docs

The developer documentation for Zulip Mobile is intended for reading on
GitHub, at https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/tree/master/docs .  It's
maintained as (GitHub-flavored) Markdown files in `docs/` in the repo.

lower: key tip: GH gist

A key tip for writing docs with any nontrivial formatting: I have a running, "secret", GitHub gist (see gist.github.com) called `tmp.md`. Whenever I'm working on our docs, I regularly go open that, edit it, ctrl-a ctrl-v to clobber it with a copy-paste of whatever I've just written, and hit the "update" button. Crude, but effective for seeing exactly how GitHub will handle my markdown.
